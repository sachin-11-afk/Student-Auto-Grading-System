Task Description In the given program, a Student Auto-Grading 
System is designed using the concepts of Object- Oriented 
Programming and coded in the programming language C++. 
This system is designed to  calculate the final result,
in terms of “Pass” and “Fail” ,of a student in a subject by
analyzing their marks in the In-semester and End-semester examinations

• A student is declared to pass a Theory course if he/she secures at least 28 marks in the End- semester examination and a total of 40 marks while taking into account both In-semester  and End-semester examinations. • A student is declared to pass a Laboratory course if he/she secures at least 35 marks in the  End-Semester examination and a total of 50 marks while taking into account both In- semester and End-semester examinations. To design the system 4 classes are used. 
They are Course.h, Theory.h,Lab.h and Student.h.
